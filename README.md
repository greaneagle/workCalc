# workCalc

V 1.3 Added some extra checkers to allow for some data entery mistakes.
        For instance if you enter 16 it will now automaticaly be treated as if you enterd 16:00 , or if you enter 8 it will be treated as 08:00.

V 1.2 Added some automatic clearing functions after anwser is recievd

V 1.1 Added the functionality to input work start time and get the end of work time as a result. 
        This is done by adding 8 hours of work and 30 minutes of break to the iputed start time.
        The start time can be inputed in HH.mm format or just H.mm format, the calculator automaticaly checks and converts it to the corect format it works with.
        
V 1.0 A simple work time calculator. A good project to learn. I will try adding features as I see fit and when I have time.
